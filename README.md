# SpacePlane

SpacePlane stuff for KOS

Basic SpacePlane and KOS script for use with Kerbal Space Program.

Only requires the KOS mod, but I like to use the "KOS For Everyone" mod for simplicity

Usage instructions are inside the takeoff.ks file but basically copy the craft file (if you want to use my demo spaceplane) in to your ksp\saves\savename\ships\SPH\ folder

and copy the takeoff.ks into ksp\ships\scripts\ folder

Load the demo plane in to the SPH and launch, right click your KOS module and open terminal

type Switch to 0. and press enter

type run takeoff. and press enter

Let the hilarity unfold.

There are things I will be adding to this over time so if it doesn't work for you, let me know what part seemed to fail and I will work on using better variables!
